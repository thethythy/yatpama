# Yet Another Tiny Password Manager or Yatpama

## Presentation

Another password manager in C language because why not ;-)

My objective is to get a simple program able to be compile without extern library link for any POSIX operating system. I will just use the ncurses library in future versions for security reasons.

## Features

- A main password protect data visibility
- The shape of the main password is controlled by a password policy
- Each information is encrypted with AES 128 (CBC mode) and save in a local file
- Each couple of secret information is controlled by an integrity value (HMAC based on SHA256)
- The encryption key (128 bits) is never saved and is generated by the AES algorithm applied 10,000 rounds in CBC mode
- The local file created is writable and readable only by the owner.

## Compilation and installation

You need a C compiler and the `make` utility or equivalent.

In a terminal, go to the `yatpama` directory.

Just type `make` and you will obtain an executable named `yatpama` to be placed in a directory accessible from your `PATH`.

`make clean` will delete all intermediate files (like `.o` files).

`make delete` will delete all executable files.

## Usage

In a terminal and a directory, a user can:
- Execute `yatpama`
- Choose a main password at first launch
- Add a new entry: a couple of secret information
- Print actual entries
- Search and print entries according a pattern

After adding the first entry, the file named `yatpama.data` will be created in the current directory. So, a file `yatpama.data` can exist in each directory if you want with a same or different main paswword.

## Todo

For now, the user can not edit or delete entries. I will add this two functionalities in future versions.

I will also add more security in the user interface (mask main password during edition, etc.).
